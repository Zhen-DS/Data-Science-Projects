1. Analyzing Toxic Comments on Wikipedia: Topic Modeling - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
2. Analyzing the Avocado Industry: Time series analysis - Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
3. Fashion Image Classification: Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Tree, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
4. Prediction of Housing Prices in the US: Time series analysis - Prophet
5. Rotten Tomatoes Movie Review Analysis: Classification/Predictive models - Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Linear Support Vector Classifier (Linear SVC), Random Forest
